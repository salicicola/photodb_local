            In case of large families, one can find taxon faster appending case sensitive anchor with genus name ( #{Genus} ) or for particular species
            ( #{Genus}:{species} ), e.g., using URL like
            /photodb/checklist/1394/all/#Bellis:perennis or /photodb/checklist/1394/all/#Bellis (1394 is an ID of aster family).
            To reach page for any particular family use URL /photodb/checklist/fams or using shortcut appending genus or family name, e.g., 
            /photodb/checklist/salicaceae or /photodb/checklist/salix (case insensitive).
